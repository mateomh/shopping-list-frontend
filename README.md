> This repo is a shopping list app to help people save money by optimizing their groceries list.


The objective of this project is to select the cheaper price for the given products and group them by store to show the user which supermarket to go the get the best price according to the date.

## Built With

- Typescript
- React
- Context api
- AGgrid
- Material-UI


## Setup Locally

To run the application locally you will need to follow several steps to make it work.

First, you have to check if you have **nodejs** installed on your machine. For this type the following command in your terminal:

> node -v

If **command not found** shows as a response, then go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and follow the instructions to install it. After completing the installation the same command should show you a version number.

Then clone the [repository](https://github.com/mateomh/shopping-list-frontend.git) into your local drive and open a terminal in the root folder of the project and install the necessary packages to make it work by running this command:

> npm install

This will get the project ready to run. After this run the following command to start the development server on **localhost:3000/** and wait for the browser to open:

> npm start

If the browser does not open or you close it by accident, but the server is still running you can type **localhost:3000/** in your address bar to get into the application again.
